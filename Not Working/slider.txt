slider.js
	There's this "  });  " part of the code which should be there according to the braces and parentheses
	is making some kind of glitch causing the scroll effect to run with mouse without it but the BTNs
	won't work after that and with it the scroll with mouse won't work but the BTNs work as supposed to

sliderfix.js 
	Just simpler version of slider.js self written but still the same problem as above

Thus ,
	Conclusion :-

		I made 3 separate javascript files
			opencenter.js		- 	1st for opening the middle page
			sliderbtn.js 		-	2nd for scrolling BTNs 
			slidermouse.js 		-	3rd for scrolling with mouse it had the error of not having "  });  " but still worked fine
